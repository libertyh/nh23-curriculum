# WIRED 2024 - MNE Python Tutorial lead by Maansi Desai, Alexandre Gramfort, and Apolline Mellot

# Getting Started
Welcome to the WIRED 2023 MNE Python Tutorial! If you're reading this, hopefully you are getting started learning how to use python and jupyter notebooks to do some analysis of neuroscience data! In this tutorial, we will be using a BIDS dataset collected from two stereo-EEG patients from the Hamilton lab. The tutorials here are organized into Jupyter notebooks that will go through a series of concepts that will give you the foundation for what you need to preprocess and plot epochs using MNE-Python.
